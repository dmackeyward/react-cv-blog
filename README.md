# A simple React application to introduce myself and showcase some of my technical and soft skills

I really enjoyed making this application which took 1.5 days to make. The parts of this project which I enjoyed was implementing the CSS animation which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yefgBA1CecI) and creating the Tennis Racquet using code image using [Bing's Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/create)
